This folder contains:

-- A compiled version of Linux Air combat in the bin/Release subfolder. (This version
   has been compiled for 64-bit PcLinusOs. It is also known to work in recent, 64-bit 
   versions of Ubuntu Linux after loading two free prerequisites with "apt-get", but 
   you may need to compile it to make it work on other distributions.)

-- An installation script named "install.sh" that will install and configure Linux Air Combat.

-- All of the source code necessary to compile or customize your own version of Linux Air Combat

-- A "Codeblocks Project File" to make it easy to use the well-known "Codeblocks" compiler GUI

-- A "bin" subfolder containing all other necessary resources
